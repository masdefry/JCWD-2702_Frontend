a. useReducer is simpler than useState in its implementation
b. useReducer separates state updates from the component, making it easier to manage complex state.

15. You have a functional component in react that has several hooks
/*
    import {useState, useEffect} from 'react';

    export default function Products(){
        const [data, setData] = useState([]);
        const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

        useEffect(() => {
            <!-- Lengkapi Code Disini -->
        }, [])

        return(
            <>
                <h1>
                    Lists Products
                </h1>
                {
                    loading?
                        'Loading...'
                    :
                        <!-- Lengkapi Code Disini -->
                }
            </>
        )
    }
*/
Complete the following code:
a. You should initialize data and loading with fake data from the start, and then update them when the actual data arrives.
b. You should add and create a new state inside useEffect to manage data and loading because you cannot use useState outsidethe return. After that, make an HTTP request directly inside useEffect.
c. You can directly use data and loading to display data in the UI without needing to use useEffect
d. In useEffect, you will send a HTTP request using fetch to fetch data from the server and populate data with the response. When the data is received, you will change the loading value to false

16. You want to access DOM elements in your react component. How would you use the useRef hook to achieve this?
/*
    import {useRef} from 'react';

    export default function Form(){
        const element = useRef()
        const handleClick = () => {
            ...
        }
        return(
            <>
                <div ref={elementRef} style={{backgroundColor: 'white'}}>
                    Lists Products
                </div>
                <button onClick={handleClick}>
                    Change Color
                </button>
            </>
        )
    }
*/
a. You can use elementRef.current.style.backgroundColor = 'blue' in the handleClick function to change the background color of the div element.
b. You can use elementRef.current.style.color = 'blue' in the handleClick function to change the background color of the div element.
c. You can use elementRef.style.backgroundColor = 'blue' in the handleClick function to change the background color of the div element
d. You can use elementRef.style.color = 'blue' in the handleClick functon to change the background color of the div element.

17. Consider the component below. What is the default color of the Icon component?
/*
    const Component = ({selected = false}) => {
        return(
            <Icon color={selected? 'green':'black'} />
        )
    }
*/
a. It returns an error code in the component
b. Black 
c. Green 
d. There is no default value.

18. Perhatikan code berikut ini! Berikut ini adalah lampiran code pada suatu project Next Js versi 14 dengan menggunakan app router.
/*
    import {useState} from 'react';

    export default function Profile(){
        const [data, setData] = useState(0)
        
        return(
            <div>
                <p>
                    {data}
                </p>
                <button onClick={() => setData(data+1)}>
                    Click Me!
                </button>
            </div>
        )
    }
*/
a. You need to define the page as server side using "use server" .
b. You need to define the page as client side using "use client" .
c. The use of useState must be accompanied by useEffect in that component.
d. The Function in the onClick must be wrapped in seperate function and initialized above before calling it.

19. Here is a functional component in react. Complete this code with the correct way to manage state and display the state value when the button is pressed.
/*
    import {useState} from 'react';

    export default function Counter(){
        <!-- Lengkapi Code Disini -->
       

        return(
            <>
                <p>Numbers: {/* Lengkapi Code Disini */}</p>
                <button onClick={/* Lengkapi Code Disini */}>Increment</button>
            </>
        )
    }
*/

a. Use this.state to initialize the count state and this.setState to update the state when the button is pressed
b. Use state to initialized the count stae and setState, and use setState to update the state when the button is pressed.
c. State is not required in functional component
d. Use useState to initialize the count state and setCount, and use setCount to update the state when the button is pressed

20. What is the main function of createSlice in redux toolkit, and why is it useful?
a. createSlice is a method for creating an instance of a slice or redux store that helps with reducer work.
b. createSlice is used to create a slice that encompasses actions in redux in one place
c. createSlice is used to create a slice that encompasses reducer, action, and state updates in one place.
d. There is no correct answer.
